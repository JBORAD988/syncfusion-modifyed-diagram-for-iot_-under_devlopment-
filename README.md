# IoT Device Live Data Visualization Platform ‚öôÔ∏è

Welcome to the IoT Device Live Data Visualization Platform! This project offers a cutting-edge solution for real-time data visualization and interaction with live IoT device streams. Users and administrators can create custom templates to monitor and manage IoT data, design workflows, and set conditions for dynamic updates, such as color changes, sounds, or images, based on sensor values.

## About the Project ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This platform is designed to simplify the visualization and management of data from various IoT devices. Users can drag and drop elements like shapes, images, and data fields onto a canvas that displays real-time sensor data. The system is perfect for users who need a highly customizable, real-time representation of IoT device data, whether it's monitoring sensor readings, tracking device status, or analyzing metrics.

## Key Features üõ†Ô∏è

Explore the powerful features of the platform:

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Integrates SignalR for seamless real-time interaction with IoT device data streams.
- **Custom Templates**: Users and admins can create, save, load, and share custom templates that automatically bind to specific data points.
- **Dynamic Drag-and-Drop Interface**: A user-friendly canvas where shapes, images, and data fields can be positioned to track sensor readings and statuses.
- **Conditional Programming**: Set conditions (e.g., play audio or change colors) when IoT data meets certain criteria (e.g., values falling below a threshold).
- **Model-Based Workflows**: Enables complex workflows for manipulating model structures and creating custom models for unique use cases.
- **Template Sharing and Editing**: Templates can be shared between users, loaded from the server, and edited or deleted as needed.
- **Advanced UI**: Built with Angular, Syncfusion, TypeScript, and SCSS to deliver a responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience.
- **Admin Tools**: Admins can customize templates with background gradients, images, and advanced color schemes.

## Template System üìê

The core of this platform lies in its robust template system, which allows users to:

- **Create and Customize Templates**: Design templates from scratch, binding them to specific data points for live IoT data tracking.
- **Set Conditional Rules**: Add rules for dynamic behavior, such as changing colors or triggering sound files when certain conditions are met (e.g., if a sensor's value drops below a specified threshold, a siren sound is played).
- **Background Customization**: Admins can add background gradients, images, and other visual elements to enhance the data visualization experience.
- **Copy and Manage Nodes**: Easily copy multiple nodes with dynamic values, enabling users to assign unique values to each node within a template.
- **Edit, Delete, and Share Templates**: Users can edit, delete, or share templates with others. Shared templates can be loaded from the server and managed through a table list.

## How It Works üîÑ

1. **Create or Load a Template**: Users or admins can create a new template or load an existing one from the server or shared devices.
2. **Drag and Drop Interface**: Use the drag-and-drop feature to position elements (shapes, images, data fields) on a canvas.
3. **Bind Data**: Each element can be bound to live data points, reflecting real-time IoT sensor readings and statuses.
4. **Set Conditional Logic**: Define rules that trigger dynamic changes, such as playing an audio file when a sensor reaches a certain value or changing the color of an element.
5. **Monitor Live Data**: View the real-time data updates on the canvas, allowing for immediate insight into the performance and status of IoT devices.
6. **Share Templates**: Share templates with other users or devices for collaborative monitoring or analysis.
